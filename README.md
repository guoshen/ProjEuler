<h1>ProjEuler</h1>

<div>
Project Euler is a website which has a extensive list of challenging programming problems, 
that are mainly geared towards the field of mathematics. Often brute-force methods will not 
work due to the massive amount of computations required for many of the problems. 
Efficient algorithms are needed to solve the problems. Check it out at <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">https://projecteuler.net/</a>

Note: I will be posting these solutions and updating them with more 
optimal solutions. I did not post all my solutions yet 
because I am in the process of revising them.
