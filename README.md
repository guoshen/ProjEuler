# ProjEuler

Project Euler is a website which has a extensive list of challenging programming problems, that are mainly geared towards the field of mathematics. Often brute-force methods will not work due to the massive amount of computations required for many of the problems. Efficient algorithms and optimizations are needed to solve the problems. Check it out at https://projecteuler.net/.  

Note: I will be posting these solutions and updating them with more optimal solutions. I did not post all my solutions yet because I am in the process of revising them.
