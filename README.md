Project Euler Solutions

Project Euler a website has a extensive list of challenging programming problems and algorithms, mainly geared towards the field of mathematics. Some of the questions are incredibly hard and often the brute force method will not work due to the massive amount of computations required for many problems. Efficient algorithms and optimizations, as well as knowledge of mathematics can be used to simplify the problems. I solve these problems in my spare time. Check it out at https://projecteuler.net/.
